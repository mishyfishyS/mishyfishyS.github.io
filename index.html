  <p>This is your space to practice, get creative, and build your own projects from scratch.</p>
  <h2> Why Twin Lakes Farm? </h2>
  <p>The best part about Twin Lakes Farm is that anyone at any level can come in to ride. From walking and trotting to jumping 2 foot, we have horses available to take care of individuals of varying levels. For those at a higher level, you are able to lease or own your horse at the south campus. There, you are able to further move up the levels and even go to various competitions.  </p>
